      <h2>Initial Settings</h2>
      <p>When you are setting Calypso's boot options you should be really careful on syntax because syntax is very important.<br>
      <p style="text-decoration:underline">You must put space before and after "=".<p>
      <p>And, fallow the instruction carefully.</p>
      <p>Instructions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>If you want Calypso to start on every boot. Set the "Start Calypso at every computer start up" setting in "bootsettings.txt" file to Yes. The "bootsettings.txt" file is in bin folder.</li>
        <p>Ex: Start Calypso at every computer start up = Yes</p>
        <li>Set the "Location to start Calypso on every start up" setting to an absolute path, that refers to the Calypso's root directory/folder using python syntax, like in the example.</li>
        <p>Ex: Location to start Calypso on every start up = E:\\work_space\\Calypso(latest-version)</p>
        <li>If you want to prevent Calypso from starting up on every boot. First, press Windows key + R, type shell:startup and, be sure the directory/folder that got open doesn't include calypso.py, becuase in windows that's the directory that windows looks up on boot to start applications. Finally, set "Start Calypso at every computer start up" to No.</li>
        <p>Ex: Start Calypso at every computer start up = No</p>
      </ol>
